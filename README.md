Fuzzy Gazetteer results are not that friendly to use. Sometimes it would be nice to plot a whole lot in a GIS to see where they are. This utility helps you with that. 

Usage:

1. Clone this repository
2. cd into the repository
3. Run ```npm install``` (make you have node.js installed first)
4. Copy the Fuzzy Gazetteer results to a text file, save it, and copy to full path to that file
5. Update the variable ```path``` in ```index.js``` with the path to the text file
6. run ```node index.js``` from the command line in this repository. Results will be added as a new csv file
